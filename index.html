--Reality Check--
Getting a job is hard, and it is getting harder. Why is it hard? Because life is hard, because school is hard, because programming is hard.
It’s not easy finding the job you want, even getting considered, and finally landing that job.
Getting a job is hard, and is getting harder. Each 
Finding the job you want is hard.
Getting considered is completely stacked against you.
The interview process is a nightmare.
Nerve wracking
Employment process is, by nature, against the applicant. You are fighting an uphill battle.
Company holds the upper hand
Your job to impress, the employer.
Why should I hire you?
Competition is tough.
Look around, everyone here is competing for the same jobs.
What separates you from every other graduate?
The process is a gauntlet, can you make it through?

						Takes a lot of time:
Your resume is extremely important. It is the only thing that can get you in the door to a completely unknown environment.
It is the single most important artifact to you during your job search. I cannot stress enough just how important it is. The content, the format, the words you use, the way you describe things, the way you prioritize things, the inflexions, the grammar, everything. Everything you have in your resume matters. Everything NEEDS to be carefully considered and calculated down the smallest detail.
Your resume is NOT an afternoon, or even a weekend project. Your resume is, in a way, a lifetime project, because your resume is you. It is a compilation of everything you are, and because of that, you cannot compromise any part of it. Which is why you cannot spend just an afternoon on it. It needs to be done very, very deliberately. It needs to be read, reread, proof read, formatted, reformatted, spacing needs to be well done, it needs to be attractive. I should be able to look at your resume and tell that you have poured time into it. Because if I am looking at your resume, and it is not put together well, what confidence have you given me that you are any better?

You are your resume:
Your resume is you. I, as your potential employer, know absolutely nothing about you besides what is written on your resume. Your resume is an ad and you are the product. You need to make me want you. You need to show me that you are valuable, you need to make me want more. It is perfectly to be terse. The idea is to start a story, and let them want to know more. I have seen it, I have read resume’s where they will describe a project and I will think it’s cool, and will interview based purely on that. I am not saying to artificially fabricate a fairy tale, no, make what you have done interesting, and most of all valuable.

Prepare yourself:
Because your resume is you, it can only ever be as good as you are. But this is a limitation on the resume, not you. Make yourself better, and update your resume to reflect that. You guys are all U of M student, with the courses you have taken, you all virtually the exact same expertise. What differentiates you from everyone else is what you have beyond your normal schoolwork. It is not hard to learn a new technology. You need to expose yourself to technologies outside your normal classwork. You need to have personal projects, and even contribute to open source if you can. You are only as strong as you make yourself. I challenge everyone here to take one weekend a month to learn something new. I understand that everyone is busy, but take the time. Find something you want to learn about, find an interesting technology, and spend a day or two learning it. You do not have to be an expert in it, just working knowledge is good. .NET and GIT are widely used technologies, and guess what? They are free, go learn them.

Like I said, your resume is what gets you in the door, it is important, you need to put in the time and effort to make it achieve its goal.

						Jeff
Designing a resume, think like a UX designer
  What are my eyes drawn to?
  How does the document flow?
    Relevant information first with the most detail; less relevant should have less detail (or removed completely)
    Space things that are related closer together

For this resume what do you see first?

A good exercise to do, look through your peers resumes
  Find what flow works
  Use it

___Typical Questions asked in a technical interview___
Matt Holfman story
  Opened Github and showed off source code
Data Structure Questions
  Stack, Queue, HashTable
Algorithms
  Binary Search
  String manipulation (anagrams are a hot topic)
  Know the runtime and tradeoffs
Design
  Model a situation

___Everything on your resume is fair game___
If you include C++/C you can get a question about C
Be ready to compare languages
  C# vs Java
  Python vs PHP

___Silence is not golden___
Interviewers don’t know what you are thinking
You should always be talking them through your thought process
That is more valuable than the solution

					<strong>Must have passion</strong>
					<br /><br />
					
					<ul style="font-size: x-large">
						<li>Strive for excellence</li>
						
						<li>Be passionate</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Continuing education</li>
							<li>Conferences, local meet-up groups</li>

--Passion--
One of the points we want to make here is that you must be passionate about what you do. Strive for excellence, and you will be successful. Continue your education. Do not stop learning just because you are out of school. The tech industry is massive, and I argue that schooling does not even scratch the surface of what technology really is. You need to take a shovel and start digging, start learning more and more. Show passion for what you do, and learn any and everything. You can do this by going to conferences and meeting up with local dev groups. Ann Arbor has one, as do most communities. Coffee house coders anyone? Conferences, anyone go to 1DevDay in Detroit? Excellent conference with a lot of great new material, and I learned a lot. Great way to source as well.
Learn your industry. This is will only benefit you. The better you understand the industry you work in, the more valuable you are, and with that always ask yourself, “Am I adding value”. I ask myself this all the time. Am I adding value? And what can I do to add more. You are more than disposable labor, you are an asset, and you should continue to be so.

					<strong>Develop soft skills</strong>
					<br /><br />
					
					<ul style="font-size: x-large">
						<li>Get to know your coworkers</li>
						<li>Interpersonal skills</li>
						<li>Conflict resolution</li>
					</ul>
					
					<aside class="notes">
						Mohammed
--Soft Skills--
And on a final note, in the working environment, soft skills are a must. Do not just show up, do your forty hours, and leave. Your career will be the single most time consuming activity in your life. Even more so than sleep. Forty hours minimum. There are one hundred sixty eight hours in a week and more than a quarter of your time will go into spending it working. I do not want that to sound somber, but it is true. You should take every effort to make it as enjoyable as possible. Get to know your coworkers. I have a personal to semi-personal relationship with virtually every person at my company. Your interpersonal skills are extremely important, despite hating group projects in school, the reality is, there is a reason they make you do them. In life, seldom will you ever be the only person working on a project. Large projects will create teams of tens of hundreds of people for a single effort. You need to be able to get along and work with other people. Conflicts will happen, and it is extremely important that you address them in a professional manner. These skills will all help you.
